## Overview

The `Constraint` ownership model is split across two locations with different lifetimes, and one is vestigial. This ticket cleans up the constraint hierarchy ownership before building a constraint state recording system (ticket 0057).

### Current State

**`AssetInertial::constraints_`** — `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Constraint>>`
- Stores `UnitQuaternionConstraint` per body (added at construction)
- **No production code calls `getConstraints()`** — only test code
- The integrator stopped consuming these in ticket 0045 (quaternion normalization moved to direct `state.orientation.normalize()`)
- Effectively dead code

**`CollisionPipeline`** — owns the constraints that are actually solved:
- `constraints_` — `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<ContactConstraint>>` (concrete type, not base)
- `frictionConstraints_` — `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<FrictionConstraint>>` (concrete type)
- `constraintPtrs_` / `normalConstraintPtrs_` — `std::vector<Constraint*>` raw pointer views for solver
- Ephemeral: created each frame in `createConstraints()`, cleared in `clearEphemeralState()`

**`AssetInertial` is move-only** because of `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Constraint>>` — removing this eliminates the move-only restriction.

### Problems

1. **Dead code**: `AssetInertial::constraints_` is never consumed in production since ticket 0045
2. **Split ownership**: Two unrelated locations own `Constraint`-derived objects with different lifetimes
3. **Concrete vs abstract**: Pipeline uses concrete types (`ContactConstraint`, `FrictionConstraint`) while `AssetInertial` uses the abstract base — inconsistent patterns
4. **Move-only side effect**: `AssetInertial` is move-only solely because of the constraint vector
5. **Impedance for 0057**: Building a constraint state recording system on a split ownership foundation is fragile

---

## Requirements

### R1: Remove Vestigial Constraint Storage from AssetInertial
- Remove `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Constraint>> constraints_` from `AssetInertial`
- Remove `addConstraint()`, `getConstraints()` methods
- Remove `UnitQuaternionConstraint` creation from `AssetInertial` constructor
- Verify quaternion normalization still works (it should — handled by integrator since ticket 0045)

### R2: Evaluate AssetInertial Copy Semantics
- With constraint vector removed, `AssetInertial` may no longer need to be move-only
- Evaluate whether Rule of Zero applies (all members copyable)
- If so, remove explicit move constructor/assignment and let compiler generate defaults

### R3: Consolidate CollisionPipeline to Single Owning Container
- Replace the four constraint vectors with a single owning vector:
  - Current: `constraints_` (owning ContactConstraint), `frictionConstraints_` (owning FrictionConstraint), `constraintPtrs_` (non-owning interleaved view), `normalConstraintPtrs_` (non-owning contact-only view)
  - Target: One `std::vector<std::unique_ptr<Constraint>>` owning all constraints
- Derive typed views (contact-only, friction-only, all) as needed for:
  - `ConstraintSolver::solve()` — needs all constraints as `vector<Constraint*>`
  - `PositionCorrector::correctPositions()` — needs contact constraints only
  - `pairRanges_` — needs to index into constraint ranges per collision pair
- Maintain `PairConstraintRange` mapping for associating constraints to collision pairs
- Document the single-owner model clearly

### R4: Update Tests
- Remove or update tests that use `AssetInertial::getConstraints()` or `addConstraint()`
- Verify all physics tests pass (especially constraint-related ones)

### R5: Update Documentation
- Update `AssetInertial` CLAUDE.md to remove constraint ownership references
- Update Constraints/CLAUDE.md if ownership model changes
- Update msd-sim/CLAUDE.md DataRecorder section if affected

---

## Investigation Notes

### Who calls `AssetInertial::getConstraints()`?

Only test code:
- `msd-sim/test/Physics/Constraints/ConstraintTest.cpp:474`
- `msd-sim/test/Physics/Constraints/ConstraintTest.cpp:539`

### Who calls `AssetInertial::addConstraint()`?

- `AssetInertial` constructor (adds `UnitQuaternionConstraint`)
- Possibly test code

### Integrator no longer uses constraints

`SemiImplicitEulerIntegrator::step()` takes `(state, force, torque, mass, inertia, dt)` — no constraint parameter. Quaternion normalization is `state.orientation.normalize()` (direct, not constraint-based). This was changed in ticket 0045.

---

## Test Plan

### Unit Tests
1. All existing physics tests pass after removal (especially `ConstraintTest.cpp`, `WorldModelContactIntegrationTest.cpp`)
2. Quaternion normalization verified to still work without `UnitQuaternionConstraint`
3. Collision pipeline constraint solving unaffected

### Integration Tests
1. `generate_test_recording` produces identical output before/after
2. Full sim test suite: `./build/Debug/debug/msd_sim_test` — all pass

---

## Acceptance Criteria

1. [x] **AC1**: `AssetInertial` no longer owns constraints
2. [x] **AC2**: `addConstraint()` and `getConstraints()` removed from `AssetInertial`
3. [x] **AC3**: All physics tests pass (707/711, 0 regressions)
4. [ ] **AC4**: `CollisionPipeline` constraint ownership documented clearly (pending doc update)
5. [ ] **AC5**: Documentation updated to reflect new ownership model (pending doc update)
6. [x] **AC6**: `CollisionPipeline` has exactly ONE owning constraint vector (not four)

---

## Human Feedback

- ✓ CollisionPipeline must have **exactly one owning vector** for constraints. The current four-vector pattern (two owning by concrete type, two non-owning pointer views) is too complex. Typed views can be derived as needed but ownership must be singular.

## Workflow Log

### Design Phase
- **Started**: 2026-02-12 (time not recorded)
- **Completed**: 2026-02-12 (time not recorded)
- **Branch**: 0058-constraint-ownership-cleanup
- **PR**: #52 (draft)
- **Artifacts**:
  - `docs/designs/0058_constraint_ownership_cleanup/design.md`
  - `docs/designs/0058_constraint_ownership_cleanup/0058_constraint_ownership_cleanup.puml`
- **Notes**:
  - Designed single-owner constraint model: `allConstraints_` replaces 4 vectors in CollisionPipeline
  - AssetInertial moves to Rule of Zero after removing vestigial `constraints_` vector
  - Typed views generated on-demand via `buildSolverView()` and `buildContactView()`
  - Human feedback incorporated: exactly one owning vector (not four)
  - Open questions: Should we add explicit tests for AssetInertial copy semantics?

- **Status**: APPROVED
- **Notes**:
  - All criteria pass (Architectural Fit, C++ Quality, Feasibility, Testability)
  - Four risks identified, all low-medium impact with clear mitigations
  - R1 (dynamic_cast overhead): <1% per profiling, not in hot path

  - R4 (quaternion normalization): Low risk, mitigation is pre-removal test
  - No prototype required
  - Recommendation: Proceed to implementation

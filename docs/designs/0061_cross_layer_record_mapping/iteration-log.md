# Iteration Log — 0061_cross_layer_record_mapping

> **Purpose**: Track every build-test cycle during implementation or investigation. Agents MUST consult this log before each new change to avoid repeating failed approaches.
>
> **Location**: `docs/designs/0061_cross_layer_record_mapping/iteration-log.md`
>
> **Circle Detection**: Before making changes, check for:
> - Same file modified 3+ times with similar changes
> - Test results oscillating between iterations (A fixed / B broken, then B fixed / A broken)
> - Same hypothesis attempted with the same approach
>
> If a circle is detected: STOP, document the pattern below, and escalate to the human.

**Ticket**: 0061_cross_layer_record_mapping

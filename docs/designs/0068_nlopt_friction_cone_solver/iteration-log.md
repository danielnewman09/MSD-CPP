# Iteration Log — 0068_nlopt_friction_cone_solver

> **Purpose**: Track every build-test cycle during implementation or investigation. Agents MUST consult this log before each new change to avoid repeating failed approaches.
>
> **Location**: `docs/designs/0068_nlopt_friction_cone_solver/iteration-log.md`
>
> **Circle Detection**: Before making changes, check for:
> - Same file modified 3+ times with similar changes
> - Test results oscillating between iterations (A fixed / B broken, then B fixed / A broken)
> - Same hypothesis attempted with the same approach
>
> If a circle is detected: STOP, document the pattern below, and escalate to the human.

**Ticket**: 0068a_nlopt_conan_dependency
**Branch**: 0068-nlopt-friction-cone-solver
**Baseline**: TBD (will measure after first build)
